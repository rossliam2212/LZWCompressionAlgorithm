Encoding algorithm

The algorithm is thus:

• At the start the dictionary contains all possible roots and P is
  empty.

• Let C be the next character in the stream

• Is the new string P+C present in the dictionary?

  a) If yes, P = P+C (extend the string P with C)

  b) If no, then

     i) Output the code word which represents P to the codestream.
    ii) Add the string P+C to the dictionary
   iii) Set P=C (P contains only C now)

• Check if there are more characters in the stream.

  a) If yes, go back to the second step.
  b) If no, then output the code representing P to the codestream and
     end.
